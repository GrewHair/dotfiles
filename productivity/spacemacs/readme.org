* IMPORTANT: the [[file:/home/boris/projects/dotfiles/productivity/spacemacs/.spacemacs][.spacemacs]] file is only _partly_ manually maintained - it is also _partly_ autogenerated!

* For this reason rather than just copying or symlinking it to the appropriate place, you really should:
** first install spacemacs
** then copy _certain_ lines and segments from the file you find here to the file generated by the new installation (after some figuring out, you should recognize what you need to copy). Roughly it's:
*** package list
*** additional packages
*** user settings
*** turn on line numbers (at line 437)
    change
    #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    dotspacemacs-line-numbers nil
    #+END_SRC
    to
    #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    dotspacemacs-line-numbers 'relative
    #+END_SRC
** delete (or rename) the file you've got here
** move the 'real' config file (to which you've just copied your configs) from your home directory to here
** only after that symlink it from here back to the home directory

* The whole [[local][/home/boris/projects/dotfiles/productivity/spacemacs/local/]] directory should be symlinked to [[/home/boris/.emacs.d/private/local/]]:
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ln -s /home/boris/projects/dotfiles/productivity/spacemacs/local/ /home/boris/.emacs.d/private/local/
  #+END_SRC
