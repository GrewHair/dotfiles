* These are my startup scripts. Their whole [[file:/home/boris/projects/dotfiles/startup/startup][folder]] should be symlinked to [[/home/boris/bin/startup]]:
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ln -s /home/boris/projects/dotfiles/startup/startup /home/boris/bin/startup
  #+END_SRC

* To add them in gnome, launch rofi and type 'startup applications'. You'll get a dialog UI like this:

  [[file:/home/boris/projects/dotfiles/startup/assets/startup_applications.png]]

  Just add them one by one.
