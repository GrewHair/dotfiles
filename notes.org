* mimic is right now basically polluting my home directory. I should 'install' it somewhere and add it to path...
* hardlinks in the scripts are becoming a problem.. I should do something about it
* I should list all the programs I'm going to need when I finally migrate
* The next major step should be to slice my dotfiles for qutebrowser and xkeysnail into modules!
